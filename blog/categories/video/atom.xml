    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick post to describe two excellent on-line resources that I have
found to be extremely helpful as we enter the mid-point of our training at
<a href="http://davincicoders.com/building-the-toolbelt-of-a-junior-ruby-on-rails-developer/">DaVinci Coders</a>.</p>

<p>The first is Ryan Bates excellent <a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts</a> series
of Ruby on Rails screencasts.  While this is a subscription service, Ryan has
generously made many of his older screencasts available for free.  The amount
of technical expertise and pro-level tips is absolutely amazing for me as a
junior Rails dev.  Prior to this I had no real notion of some of the topics
that RailsCasts covers, but now that I&rsquo;m working with Rails every day, this
content is absolutely priceless.</p>

<p>The second is the CodeShip series called <a href="http://blog.codeship.io/category/testing-tuesday">Testing Tuesday</a>.  As the name suggest, these are short video
tutorials on various aspects of TDD and BDD tools and skills, like RSpec,
Cucumber, and other languages beyond Ruby and Rails.  Even better, these are
free.  They are also posted online at <a href="https://vimeo.com/codeship">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>The beauty of both of these resources, and I&rsquo;m sure there are others, is that
they are short and to the point. Each are about 10 minutes long, and address
a problem or provide an overview of a technique that you can put to work right
away.</p>

<p>Next time you are browsing the web and watching <a href="www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>
 videos, take a look at one of these resources and learn something that will
 make you a better developer.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><blockquote><p>What do you despise?  By this are you truly known.</p><footer><strong>Frank Herbert</strong> <cite>Dune</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>We hear the term &ldquo;agile&rdquo; all the time in the development world.  What does it
really mean?  Everything seems to have the term agile attached to it.</p>

<p>It came up in class tonight as we were introduced to Pivotal Tracker, and the
paradigm behind it.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can figure out what something is by what it is not.  A few weeks
ago I came across a video on Vimeo that addressed this.  Enjoy&hellip;</p>
