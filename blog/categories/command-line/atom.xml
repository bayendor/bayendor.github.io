    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you begin to work with branching in git, one of the first commands you
learn is <code>git branch</code>, which gives output similiar to this:
<code>bash
  57933296_assignments_dropdown_master
* 6724_refactor_master
  master
</code>
The branch identified by the <code>*</code> on line 2 is the current branch.</p>

<p>In the heat of coding it can be useful to know what branch you are on lest you
 make a commit, push code, or pull from the wrong branch.  Since branches are
  analogous to directories, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if the terminal prompt could
  tell us not only what directory we were in, but what branch we were on?</p>

<p>As an example, my terminal prompt looks like this:
<code>bash
[~/workspace/blog]
(master) $
</code>
Line 1 is my current working directory, on line two in <code>( )</code> is
the current git branch <code>master</code>.  Pretty useful.</p>

<p>I cannot take any credit for this. The code I present below was passed on to
me by another developer, who also had no idea where it came from.  I would
give credit if I knew who to give it to, but instead I give thanks.</p>

<p>In your <code>.bash_profile</code> you will need to add the following code
snippet to enable parsing of the git branch from the environment:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>git prompt settings</h1>

<p>parse_git_branch() {
git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e &lsquo;/^[^<em>]/d&rsquo; -e &rsquo;s/</em> (.*)/(\1)/&lsquo;
}
export -f parse_git_branch
```</p>

<p>Now you can add <code>parse_git_branch</code> to your prompt settings in
<code>.bash_profile</code>, like this:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>prompt</h1>

<p>export PS1=&ldquo;[\w]\n\$(parse_git_branch) \$ &rdquo;
```</p>

<p>Feel free to experiment, and an on-line search will yield many examples.</p>

Command Line Fu &ndash; <a href="http://xkcd.com/196/">xkcd.com</a>
This cartoon is particularly amusing because&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last twenty-four hours working through
<a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/">The Command Line Crash Course</a>
as homework for class.  In addition our instructor had us log our progress in
Pivotal Tracker by having us work through &ldquo;stories&rdquo; to test our knowledge.</p>

<p>Overall it was excellent, since we got exposure to two parts of the development
environment at the same time: using and working the command line, and learning a
tool that is a de-facto standard in the development industry.</p>

<p>What did I learn?</p>

<p>Pay attention to the stories, details are important, so don&rsquo;t rush ahead or you&rsquo;ll
miss something.  My first few stories in Pivotal Tracker were rejected for that reason.</p>

<p>Using the command line is both frustrating and confidence inspiring.  You get the
feeling you are really interacting with the environment.  The abstraction of GUI&rsquo;s has
made many people feel that they &ldquo;understand&rdquo; computers, but the reality is not that
simple.</p>

<p>I grew up using CP/M, DOS, and even did some time on a VAX 11/750 mini-computer.  As
a result I&rsquo;m comfortable with basic aspects of the command line.  But as I&rsquo;ve been
delving into development I&rsquo;ve seen command lines that I&rsquo;ve had to use and have simply
cut and paste them without being entirely sure what they do or how they do it.</p>

<p>The classic was <code>grep</code>.  I was always fascinated by what it was doing, and
how it was so often used in combination with pipes or redirects.  Prior to this I
never really had a reason to use it.  Since we do so much work with text and files,
I see how useful it can be.</p>

<p>In other news I did some fiddling with the blog and added a twitter feed for a list
of Rubyists that I follow.  Check it out in the sidebar to the right.</p>

<p>Thanx for reading.  Stay tuned for more from the front lines&hellip;</p>
