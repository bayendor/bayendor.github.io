    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently came across the most amazing piece of video footage while watching
a documentary on the technology used during the Apollo missions of the late
1960&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>That era was a little bit like an alternate decade of the 21st century that
sort of just showed up in the middle of the 20th century.  In addition to
tremendous leaps in aviation and space-flight that decade gave us advances
 in medical, material, and computer science.</p>

<p>To put it in perspective, the working memory of the navigation computer for
the Apollo missions was just 72 kilobytes!  Things that we take for granted
now had to be invented from scratch, including interrupt driven multi-processing
algorithms and reliable data storage.</p>

<p>For a fascinating look at how the latter was solved, watch this video:</p>

<p>For more about this amazing and lost technology see the Wikipedia entry: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_rope_memory">Core Rope Memory</a></p>

<p>On a separate note, this is a fascinating and possibly forgotten example of
diversity in coding.</p>

<p>A: an individual whose teenage exposure to computing consisted of
a plethora of home computers based on the venerable 6502 CPU.  This would
include, but not be limited to: Commodore VIC-20 or 64, the Texas Instruments
TI series, the Apple II (+, e, c), and the Atari 400/800.</p>

<p>If your parents only saw fit to buy you one of the Radio Shack TRS models you
have my sympathy.</p>

<p>You likely saw the movie &ldquo;War Games&rdquo; in the movie theater when it was first
released, but your parents probably had to drive you there.  Give yourself extra
credit for admitting to having a crush on Ally Sheedy&rsquo;s character.</p>

<p>Most of my friends were Apple fanboys.  I myself trod a different path, and was
an Atari man.  These were the heady days of home computing, where 48K of RAM,
1.8 MHz clock-speeds and 1200 baud dial-up modems were bleeding edge technology.</p>

<p>If you cut your teeth on these 8-bit machines, then you, too, are a veteran of
the 8-bit wars.</p>

<p>While the first hackers came from the mainframed halls of academia (e.g. MIT),
the second wave began on these machines.  If you got your start on Intel x86
hardware you are not, by definition, an 8-bit Veteran.</p>

<p>P.S.  If you had an Amiga or an Atari ST, you have taken a different path, one
worthy of particular awe&hellip;</p>
