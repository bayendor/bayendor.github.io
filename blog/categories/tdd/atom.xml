    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick post to describe two excellent on-line resources that I have
found to be extremely helpful as we enter the mid-point of our training at
<a href="http://davincicoders.com/building-the-toolbelt-of-a-junior-ruby-on-rails-developer/">DaVinci Coders</a>.</p>

<p>The first is Ryan Bates' excellent <a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts</a> series
of Ruby on Rails screencasts.  While this is a subscription service, Ryan has
generously made many of his older screencasts available for free.  The amount
of technical expertise and pro-level tips is absolutely amazing for me as a
junior Rails dev.  Prior to this I had no real notion of some of the topics
that RailsCasts covers, but now that I&rsquo;m working with Rails every day, this
content is absolutely priceless.</p>

<p>The second is the CodeShip series called <a href="http://blog.codeship.io/category/testing-tuesday">Testing Tuesday</a>.  As the name suggests, these are short video
tutorials on various aspects of TDD and BDD tools and skills, like RSpec,
Cucumber, and other languages beyond Ruby and Rails.  Even better, these are
free.  They are also posted online at <a href="https://vimeo.com/codeship">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>The beauty of both of these resources &ndash; and I&rsquo;m sure there are others &ndash; is that
they are short and to the point. Each are about 10 minutes long, and address
a problem or provide an overview of a technique that you can put to work right
away.</p>

<p>Next time you are browsing the web and watching <a href="www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>
 videos, take a look at one of these resources and learn something that will
 make you a better developer.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><blockquote><p>Outside-in development often feels strange to newcomers. Most developers prefer to start with the “important” part of an application &hellip; Thinking like a server and not a client can lead to overengineering by implementing more than you need. Your resulting objects and their interfaces will also be less than optimal, or at least take longer to get quite right.</p><footer><strong>Jared Carroll <a href="http://blog.carbonfive.com/2012/02/14/beginning-outside-in-rails-development-with-cucumber-and-rspec/">http://blog.carbonfive.com/2012/02/14/beginning-outside-in-rails-development-with-cucumber-and-rspec/</a> Beginning Outside-In Rails Development with Cucumber and RSpec</strong></footer></blockquote>
We have started exploring test drive development in class, which can be a bit
of a conceptual shift.  TDD goes hand in glove with Agile practices because it
 encourages rapid delivery of working code, in discrete steps.  As
a bonus it creates a living document of the development process that can be
used further down the road of an applications life-cycle to make sure that no
new code breaks any of the old code.</p>

<p>The quote above comes from an excellent blog entry by Jared Carroll, <a href="http://blog.carbonfive.com/2012/02/14/beginning-outside-in-rails-development-with-cucumber-and-rspec/">Beginning Outside-In Rails Development with Cucumber and RSpec</a>.
Jared gives an overview of how TDD should work. Anyone getting started in TDD should read it and let it sink in.</p>

<p>On another note, as aspiring junior web-devs, this recent
<a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/">thoughtbot</a> podcast is worth listening to:
<a href="https://learn.thoughtbot.com/giantrobots/59">podcast #59: Nowhere to Hide</a>.</p>

<p>In the episode, Ben Orenstein speaks with thoughtbot CTO Joe Ferris about the technical interview process at thoughtbot, and more.</p>

<p>Thanx for reading, stay tuned for more from the frontlines&hellip;</p>
